# xiv-active-ls

[fetch](fetch.html) is a tool that will fetch a list of current members of a linkshell
and record their {class, title, levels, gear, mounts, minions} in a file that you can save.
It scrapes Lodestone via [XIVAPI](https://xivapi.com) and can take several minutes.

[compare](compare.html) compares two files produced by the fetch tool and describes the differences between them.

The intended use is for linkshell masters or leaders to compare today's fetch with one from eg. several months ago,
and identify members who are inactive (ie. haven't had any character changes in a long time) as candidates to be kicked.
